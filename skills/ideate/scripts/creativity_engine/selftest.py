"""End-to-end self-test with a stubbed LLM and a stubbed human.

No interactive input, no live model. It exercises the whole loop on a
domain-neutral brief + generic axes and then proves two things:

* **Variety gate** — the engine's diverse slate beats a single-shot baseline on
  mean pairwise distance, Vendi score, and niche entropy; DPP selection beats
  naive first-N on the *same* pool, **shuffled** (so first-N isn't trivially the
  near-clones) and **averaged over several seeds** (so the win isn't a fluke);
  and a **null check** confirms DPP does not regress below a random subset on an
  already-uniform pool. This gate proves **variety** geometry *only* — not
  originality vs. the world, nor value; what it leaves unvalidated is spelled out
  in ``variety_gate["coverage_gaps"]``.
* **Induced-collapse reversal** — a samey generation trips the monitor, and once
  diversity pressure is raised the next generation recovers.
* **Live semantic check** (``--live`` only) — a paraphrase is more similar than an
  unrelated sentence under the real default embedder (the torch-free multilingual
  ``static`` model); skipped cleanly when that embedder can't be built/downloaded.
* **Originality probe** (advisory) — distance from the diverse slate to a held-out
  "obvious-set". Reported for visibility only; it is **not** part of the variety
  gate and **never** included in ``ok`` (originality is measured, never selected on).

The stubbed LLM is a canned candidate generator; the stubbed human auto-picks the
highest-novelty idea in each slate.
